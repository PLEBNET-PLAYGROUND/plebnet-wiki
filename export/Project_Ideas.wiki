This is a page to track project ideas. What does the PlebNet need building?

* Better visualization tools, e.g create playbacks of an entire day's forwarding events
* Basic auto-balancing scripts
** Existing packages that could be used as starting point: [https://github.com/C-Otto/rebalance-lnd rebalance-lnd], [https://github.com/alexbosworth/balanceofsatoshis BOS]
* [[/plebnet.wiki/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Plebnet_Playground|Plebnet Playground]]
* GirthMatrix - VR girth experience (e.g. https://plebnet.satoshis.tech/3d )
* Self account creation for wiki - perhaps using new Amboss groups and then signing message with node
* Software to automatically rebalance a node: set a budget, it takes care of keeping node balanced.
* Software to automatically set fees. Analyze flows, and set fees with the aim of keeping the node channels balanced.
** Existing packages that could be used as starting point: [https://github.com/accumulator/charge-lnd charge-lnd]
* A site that logs nodes through which payments happen easily, versus nodes through which payments fail a lot
* Better / advanced reporting
