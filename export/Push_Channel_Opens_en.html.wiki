&quot;Ghetto Submarine Swaps&quot; can be reduced to a two-step process as long as your client has the ability to specify a local amount and a push amount.

== <span id="push_channel_opens_with_lncli" class="mw-headline">push channel opens with lncli</span> ==

lncli has this ability built-in. For example, to open a balanced 5M channel:

<code>lncli openchannel --node_key &lt;node_key&gt; --local_amt 5000000 --push_amt 2500000 --sat_per_vbyte 1</code>

Do note that 'local amount' is 5M, because it represents the channel's total girth, however since we *push* half, the channel is balanced. This effectively reduces a ghetto submarine swap to two steps:

* node 1: open channel with N local and N/2 push
* node 2: send N/2 to node 1, on-chain
