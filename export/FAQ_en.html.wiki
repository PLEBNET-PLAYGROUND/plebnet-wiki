== <span id="Q1_Recommendations_for_Good_Peers" class="mw-headline">Q1 Recommendations for Good Peers</span> ==

There is no straightforward recommendation.

1- I would recommend all my channels as good peers. My channel list is [https://amboss.space/node/03c5528c628681aa17ab9e117aa3ee6f06c750dfb17df758ecabcd68f1567ad8c1 public (like everyone else)]

2- [https://terminal.lightning.engineering/ Terminal] ranks peers based on their criteria.

3- [https://lnnodeinsight.com/ lnnode] helps you do channel simulation of how your centrality is impacted by adding someone as a peer.

4- [https://gridflare.xyz/ gridflare] provides recommendations individual to your own channel.

5- Communicating within [https://t.me/plebnet plebnet groups] let you interact with node operators who you can judge from their interaction as good peers

6- ultimately anyone willing to open up their node for routing and investing, time, effort, and sats to operate a lightning node is a good peer.

== <span id="Q2_Other_node_cannot_connect_to_my_TOR_node" class="mw-headline">Q2 Other node cannot connect to my TOR node</span> ==

If the other node is a clearnet node, you would need to add them as peer first before they can connect/open channel to you. You can add peer via RTL/ThunderHub or other apps or using command line <code>~/umbrel/bin/lncli connect &lt;PubKey or URI of the peer&gt;</code>. For example to connect to my node as peer, please use

<code>~/umbrel/bin/lncli connect 03c5528c628681aa17ab9e117aa3ee6f06c750dfb17df758ecabcd68f1567ad8c1</code>

OR

<code>~/umbrel/bin/lncli connect 03c5528c628681aa17ab9e117aa3ee6f06c750dfb17df758ecabcd68f1567ad8c1@zacadqiqgi43tdv4ztjet2fh22f72ol2tokotp5cqdbszgx6tpyqdxad.onion:9735</code>

[https://github.com/smallworlnd/stream-lnd-htlcs steam-lnd-htlc] is script used to monitor HTLC events on your node. However the output is in JSON format which may not immediately be human readable format. This can be solved by adding a custom alias

<pre>alias strhtlc='tail -f ~/stream-lnd-htlcs/htlc-stream.json | sed -e '\''s/, /\n/g'\'' -e '\''s/{/\n{\n/g'\'' -e '\''s/}/\n}/g'\'' -e '\''s/'\''\'\'''\''//g'\'''</pre>
replace <code>~/stream-lnd-htlcs/htlc-stream.json</code> by the actual path of your output file from stream-lnd-htlc script.

after this each time you type <code>strhtlc</code> you will start looking at the output which you can read on screen. To stop press ctrl-c

you can add this line in your aliases files so that it is remembered each time.

<code>nano ~/.bash_aliases</code> add the line

<pre>alias strhtlc='tail -f ~/stream-lnd-htlcs/htlc-stream.json | sed -e '\''s/, /\n/g'\'' -e '\''s/{/\n{\n/g'\'' -e '\''s/}/\n}/g'\'' -e '\''s/'\''\'\'''\''//g'\'''</pre>
<br />
Save and Exit <code>ctrl-x then Y then enter</code>

1. You can run in TMUX. See [[/plebnet.wiki/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Umbrel_-_Installing_BoS#TMUX_Instructions|Umbrel_-_Installing_BoS#TMUX_Instructions]] for high-level instructions on installing tmux.

2. Use disown <code>python3 stream-lnd-htlcs.py --lnd-dir ~/umbrel/lnd --silent SILENT --human-dates HUMANDATES 1&gt;/tmp/stream-lnd-htlc.log 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp; disown</code>

Theoretically yes, you need to understand that for being profitable you need to recover the initial investments as well as ongoing costs. Your investments are in the hardware, UPS, etc. Your ongoing costs are electricity, internet charges, hosting fees if you run in the cloud, and channel open/close costs. In addition, you may optionally spend on rebalancing.

Therefore a very small node is unlikely to return to profitability over its useful life before new investments in hardware would be needed.

Considering the cost of hardware around 1.5M Sat and the expected lifetime of hardware as 5 years, a 10 M Sat node would need to earn 300_000 Sat a year (1_500_000/5) or 2,500 ppm (300_000/12/10) net profit per month to recover the investment. Assuming the node can route 100% of the local balance in a month, the node would need to earn 2,500 ppm net fees for each routing. In the same situation, a 100 M Sat node would need to earn the same 300_000 Sats a year but it drops to 250 ppm (300_000/12/100) net profit per month to recover the investment. Assuming the node can route 100% of the local balance in a month, the node can be profitable with just 250 ppm net fees for each routing.

Therefore larger the node, the higher the chances of achieving profitability.

There is genuinely no straight answer to this question and each node is unique in its objective and structure. However, it is easier to build a base first before worrying about centrality and hopness. Generally as a rule of thumb keep

# 30% capital for big chunky channels possibly to main routes (which you would discover only after watching the flow). These could the from the top 50 or 100 from [https://terminal.lightning.engineering/#/03c5528c628681aa17ab9e117aa3ee6f06c750dfb17df758ecabcd68f1567ad8c1 Terminal Engineering] or channels which improve your centrality, betweenness, and hopness. See the section on [[/plebnet.wiki/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Resources|Resources]] for more details.
# 40% for swaps/balanced channels you open in community which gives you one inbound to one outbound with well-connected nodes (you can do rings/triangle etc). Plebnet, #Plebs2Salvador, and other swap services are good place for these nodes.
# Remaining 30% for building the community/fun projects/helping/mentoring beginners nodes. The smaller nodes today could be next big deal for tomorrow.
