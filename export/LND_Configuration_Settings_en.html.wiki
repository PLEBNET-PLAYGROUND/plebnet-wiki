WARNING: If you are running Umbrel not all of these configuration settings are open to you currently, because Umbrel does not compile all the flags for LND daemon. If you use a setting that isn't valid to your LND service will not start up.

<pre>    Ever since the Lightning Network has started and when people began opening channels with others they have been trying to get the most out their Node.  People have been doing this ever since computers have gotten into peoples hands.  Trying out different settings and finding out what works best.</pre>
Anyone who would love to go over a long list of config parameters which can be used could check out this Lnd GitHub page https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/sample-lnd.conf

<pre>    There are more entries then I ever thought possible, but this Wiki page is how to make adjustments to the Lightning Node environment which helps ones node to perform better.  Something which we'd all would like to happen.</pre>
The list which follows is the most common settings which Node Operators have come to agree which best suites a Node which wants to earn fees and route other Nodes Payments. These settings apply to LND 0.12.1 releases. The latest release still has many issues which need to be resolved.

A full list of all LND settings can be found here: https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/sample-lnd.conf

<br />


<span id="for-the-settings-to-take-effect"></span>
== <span id="For_the_Settings_To_Take_Effect" class="mw-headline">For the Settings To Take Effect</span> ==

For the settings to take effect, you will need to restart lnd. Do not restart entire node.

Restart lnd <code> cd ~/umbrel ; docker-compose restart lnd; docker-compose ps </code>

For non umbrel, the instructions could be different.

<br />


<span id="opening-channel-with-predefined-fees"></span>
== <span id="Opening_Channel_With_Predefined_Fees" class="mw-headline">Opening Channel With Predefined Fees</span> ==

With lnd you can set up fees only once the channel is opened. You cannot set fees on pending channels. Unless you have a predefined fees setup, the channel open with default fees (which is 1 Sat Base Fee and 1 ppm fee rate). Now it could be too low for your liking and sometimes, when you open channel with low on-chain fees (1 Sat/Vb) it could take a long time to confirm, sometimes overnight. If you want to sleep with peace that when your open the channel, it will be with your desired default fee you can make the following additions to your lnd.conf.

The section below should be in the [Bitcoin] section of the lnd.conf file.

{| class="wikitable wikitable"
|-
! Setting
! Description
|-
| bitcoin.basefee=1000
| The base fee in millisatoshi we will charge for forwarding payments on our channels. This setting is equivalent to 1 Sat base fee.
|-
| bitcoin.feerate=2500
| The fee rate used when forwarding payments on our channels. The total fee charged is basefee + (amount * feerate / 1000000), where the amount is the forwarded amount. This setting is equivalent to 2500 ppm fee.
|}

<br />


<span id="watch-tower-settings"></span>
== <span id="Watch_Tower_Settings" class="mw-headline">Watch Tower Settings</span> ==

<pre>    Pretty good name for what this does.  Watch Towers are communications between agreeing Nodes to keep on eye on each others Node.  Node Operators pass their Watch Tower address between each other so when one of them is down for some reason, the other one watches for channel situations like a forced close.  If this closure tries to use a non-current Channel state, then the Watch Tower will step in and penalize the Node trying to cheat.
    Currently, the fee for watching another Node is disabled, but at some point there will be a cost with this.  Now if your Node does catch some foul play one will earn fees for being the good guy.</pre>
adding the following to your lnd.conf should do the job

<pre>[wtclient]
wtclient.active=true
wtclient.sweep-fee-rate=10

[watchtower]
watchtower.active=true</pre>
{| class="wikitable wikitable"
|-
! Setting
! Description
|-
| wtclient.active=true
| Turns on the Watch Tower Client (in the [wtclient] section of lnd.conf)
|-
| wtclient.sweep-fee-rate=10
| Sets the watchtower client sweep fee in sats/vbyte for the justice transaction (in the [wtclient] section of lnd.conf)
|-
| watchtower.active=true
| Enable integrated watchtower server listening on :9911 by default. (in the [watchtower] section of lnd.conf)
|}

Restart lnd <code> cd ~/umbrel ; docker-compose restart lnd; docker-compose ps </code>

check watch tower server status <code>~/umbrel/bin/lncli tower info</code>

the output will confirm your watch tower server status. It will also provide you a pubkey. If you want to allow your friends to add you as their watch tower give them this URI. Do not distribute willy nilly. This is different from your pubkey.

<code> { </code>

<pre>   &quot;pubkey&quot;: &quot;XXXXX00000XXXX0000&quot;,
   &quot;listeners&quot;: [
       &quot;[::]:9911&quot;
   ],
   &quot;uris&quot;: [
       &quot;ABC123@XYZ123:9911&quot;
   ]</pre>
<code>} </code>

Similarly, your friend (who you want to add as your watch tower) must give you their URI for you to add them as your watch tower.

Once you have their URI, add as <code>~/umbrel/bin/lncli wtclient add &lt;URI provided&gt;</code>

You can find details of [https://lightningnetwork.plus/watchtower LN+ watchtower here] if you want to use them as watchtower. You do not need to follow other instructions, just use their watchtower URI for tor or for clearnet.

Check if all is ok as watchtower client <code>~/umbrel/bin/lncli wtclient towers</code> This will give you a list of watchtowers your node is connected to. You can keep 2-4 nodes as your watch towers.

Check the statistics <code>~/umbrel/bin/lncli wtclient stats</code>
